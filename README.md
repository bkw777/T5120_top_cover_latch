## compatibility
The new parts are both compatible with the mating original parts.  
So for example if your frame is broken but you still have the original bolt (the green moving part), you can keep using the original bolt.

## printing
There is really no good orientation to print the bolt by FDM. The best is with the pawl face down on supports.
The springs put constant pressure on the wings so it should not be printed on it's side, only flat or vertical.

## hardware
Common pen springs work in place of the original springs.

The mounting screws are 3M x 6mm
